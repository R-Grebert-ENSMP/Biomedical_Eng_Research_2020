# TR_Sante_2020
Algorithm for the trimestre of biomedical research internship during my Mines de Paris scolarship.

Simulated the forced expiration manoeuvre based on research papers from a vast array of contributers. Please refer to the file "Rapport TR" for more details about the project and the code.
The Python files are different versions of the algorithm I developped at different stages of my research. 

They are unfortunately not clean yet. The result of this research being the "Rapport" and not the algorithm itself.
